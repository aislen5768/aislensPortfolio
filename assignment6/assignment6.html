	<p>"Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So,
	love the people who treat you right, forgive the ones who don't and believe that everything happens for a reason.
	If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said it'd be easy,
	they just promised it would be worth it"</p>

	<p>"You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
		You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go.."</p>

	<p>Living your everyday life can be simple to some people but to me it feels like I need to go where my heart desires.
	Time keeps going by fast so caring about what others do or say to you should not matter.
	There is only a certain amount of time,years, or seconds before that opportunity you dream of dissapears.
	The only person who can control you is you. What happens to you wether its offending or upsetting it will only be that if you let it be upsetting to you.
	Life is full of challanges but not full of time. Going for everything you want and following your passion should be an everyday thing.</p>
	
	<p>Being yourself is the best version of you. If you believe in yourself and the things you can do, you will achieve anything.
	As high as you want to go in life you will only be able to achieve it by telling yourself what anyone else tells you does not matter.
	You may be doing much better than the people who neglected you or did not believe in you once you show them how much you have become.
	Life is full of events and it's always good to have fun and have struggles. But never forget why you fought.</p>
