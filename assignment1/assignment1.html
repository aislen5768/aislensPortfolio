	<p class="box">The Internet has always been a part of my life and others who have grown up with it. The internet is known for hiding many things and exposing them for the world to see. I remember having my moms old phone that you could slide open and it had its own mini keyboard.
	 Or when I would be at my fathers workplace and play the games that were very popular and last resort like chess, or cards. The internet is starting to evolve and has been evolving into something else, something greater. Or so most of us think.
	  Kate Wagner goes into explaining how her life was when the internet was mostly new and how life was for her as she was growing up and how it affected her life as she grew older.</p>	
	<p class="box">"that old warning from your parents that says to "be careful what you post online because it will be there forever". This particularly relates to me especially, My parents would always let me know of the dangers that there is regarding the internet.
		 Whether it's meeting random strangers that arent of any good or seeing things that are not appropriate for a kid to be looking at or reading. When talking about how the internet was in the past and how many people miss it, Kate Wagner notices how those two different time zones between now and the past were very different.
		  Sure the internet was still evolving back then, But when Kate Wagner explains how they miss the old internet they are referring to how there were not a lot of major events happening during that time. There were not a lot of influencers or people on the internet constantly to how the internet is now.
		   Missing the Old Phase we were in when the internet was just barely getting started.</p>
		<p class="box">The old apps and websites contained memories from someone's peak at life just how Kate Wagner was feeling about it. “Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre social media internet. The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet".
			 Speaking about the past, Kate Wagner also mentioned a statement from danah boyd that stayed with her on how at some point some apps got divided by class or some were claimed by those who fit the class.
			  “One of the more interesting essays from and about the late-Myspace to early-Facebook period came from danah boyd, who wrote about the class divisions inherent to certain social media platforms". There was an interview held with different teenagers in order to talk about the apps. 
			  “One white teen, for instance, called Myspace a “ghetto,” and another described Facebook as “the place where the "honors kids" got together and discussed how they were procrastinating over their next AP English essay".</p>
			  <p class="box"> Seeing the way facebook first got introduced to Harvard and then other Ivy League schools, It connects to why it came to that point with the internet. Parents even started to view Facebook as a safer app for their children rather than MySpace that started to be more surrounded around inappropriate use.
				 Kate Wagner then goes on to talk about how the internet has got us spending most of our time on our phones but most of it is due to the fact that we have the apps downloaded onto the phones. "Today, roughly 90 percent of time spent on our phones is devoted to apps—not the web.
				  The web didn't adapt fast enough, and companies these days don't bother wasting time on mobile browsing. They prefer to nag us into “downloading the app". People spend most of their time on their phone on the apps that they have downloaded instead on the web. 
				   Furthermore it is clear on the effects the internet has on us and the way it has affected others.</p>
